# Welcome!
## What is this repository?
This is where the machine.xml file for BYU's pick and place machine is located.
## Why is there only one file?
This project is still a work in progress. However, the machine.xml file is the heart and soul of every pick and place machine that runs OpenPNP (like ours).
## What's the point?
Copy the machine.xml into your .openpnp folder and you should be able to properly import our configuration into your setup.
You'll need a machine, packages, parts, and vision-settings file.
