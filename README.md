# Welcome!
## What is this repository?
This is where the machine.xml file for BYU's pick and place machine is located.
## What's the point?
Copy the machine.xml files into your .openpnp folder and you should be able to properly import our configuration into your setup.
You'll need the most recent machine, packages, parts, and vision-settings file.
